## Packages

## Replication data set
```{r, include=FALSE}
# The following code loads the data used in the study by Wunderlich et al. (2020). This is the data set needed to reproduce the results of the initial analysis. See report for description of variables needed.

##  Additional seasons
If you want to download the original files. Visit \url{http://www.football-data.co.uk/} go to "Historical Data" and download each single season for the needed divisions as an .csv file. 
As this is very tedious this is provided already. However, I am going to show you the process of how to retrieve the data for the new seasons and how to bring them in the needed format for data analysis.
